Hello! I am a cybersecurity researcher working at the intersection of policy and emerging technologies. I also lead the inventorying workstream for the Post-Quantum Cryptography center at Comcast. I am currently a Public Policy Researcher in the [Comcast Cyber Security](https://corporate.comcast.com/ccs-research) team (led by the amazing [Dr. Vaibhav Garg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gargvaibhav/)). I was previously working in the same team as a Privacy Engineer, helping build privacy threat modeling processes within the organization (and also open-sourcing them!). I hold a PhD in Security Informatics from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) where I worked on privacy-preserving technologies in conversational platforms with [Professor L. Jean Camp](https://www.ljean.com/). My research interests are in inclusive and usable privacy. 

I have been a Google Public Policy fellow in cybersecurity policy and a co-lead researcher in a National Science Foundation multi-year investigation into IoT privacy. I have also been involved in teaching, research, and service at Indiana University Bloomington.

I also hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from West Bengal Univerity of Technology, where I got introduced to cryptography through Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. 

Outside of work, I like traveling (with lots of hiking) and reading manga.
